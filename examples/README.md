# Examples

Here there are different examples to show how the builder works

## 3e0d

3e0d is a complex that is part of the replisome. Is formed by 2 protein chains 
(2 monomers of the same protein) that binds to DNA. In particular, is the subunit that recognises
the target DNA to start the replication.

In this case, where there are 3 different chains and there's only one possible interaccion betweem them
the complex is build in a few seconds.
