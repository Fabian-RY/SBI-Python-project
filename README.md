## Introduction

Promod is a Python tool whose goal is to model macrocomplexes of  molecules starting from the interacting pairs of chains that will form  the complex. It is compatible with protein chains, single and double DNA strands and RNA strands. It has several parameters available to adjust  according to the users needs.

In essence, the builder approach is similar to a genomic assembler:  it seeks for similar chains in the different PDB files given as input  and overlaps them. The builder places pair by pair all the possible  chains into a single model.
